# Production environment configuration

# API URL Configuration:

# 1. For same-origin deployment (API and frontend on same domain):
VITE_API_URL=

# 2. For different-origin deployment (API on different domain):
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com

# Notes:
# - Empty VITE_API_URL means use relative paths (recommended for same-origin deployment)
# - If API is on a different domain, ensure CORS is properly configured on the backend
# - Backend CORS settings must include the frontend's domain in allowed origins
# - Make sure to use HTTPS in production for both frontend and API URLs
