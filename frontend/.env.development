# Development environment configuration

# API URL Configuration
# Choose ONE of these configurations:

# 1. For local development (using localhost):
VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.64:8000

# 2. For development with specific IP:
# VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.64:8000

# 3. For development with relative path (if API is on same origin):
# VITE_API_URL=

# Notes:
# - The API must be configured to accept CORS requests from your frontend origin
# - If using IP/localhost, ensure the backend CORS settings include your frontend URL
# - If the frontend and API are on the same origin, you can use relative path (empty VITE_API_URL)
